# League-Project
Using Riot's API to model player behavior and outcomes in the game League of Legends.  The first project has been to teach myself enough python to access Riot's public API to compile a data set of approximately 12 variables from the past 300 or so games of a given player's match history.  I used these data sets to build models to assess what variables may be useful for predicting whether the player will win or lose a match.

Table of Contents:
* *Python-API-Data-Compiler* - My first python program - teaching myself from scratch to access Riot's API to compile a data set to use for building models.
* *Report for Player T.md* - A report about a model I built using data compiled with the above Python program.  
  * *Player T Analysis.R* - Here you can look at the code I wrote in R to analyze the data set and build the model discussed in this report.  
*  *Report for Player A.md* - A follow up report focusing on a different style of player to compare models.  
  * *Player A Analysis.R* - The code I wrote in R to analyze the data set and build the model for this report.
